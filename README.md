## üíæ Dataset Information

**Source:** Reserve Bank of India ‚Äî Database on Indian Economy (DBIE).
**Time span:** Annual observations, **1950 ‚Äì 2024**.

### Variables / Metrics used

* `Year` ‚Äî time index (1950‚Äì2024)
* `GDP` ‚Äî Gross Domestic Product (nominal or real as in RBI file)
* `GNI` ‚Äî Gross National Income
* `NNI` ‚Äî Net National Income
* `PerCapita_GDP`, `PerCapita_GNI`, `PerCapita_NNI` ‚Äî per-capita metrics
* `CPI_AllIndia` ‚Äî Consumer Price Index (all-India) / Inflation_Rate derived from CPI
* `CPI_IW` ‚Äî Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (where available)
* Additional RBI variables included where present (e.g., real GDP growth, index series)

> All datasets are cleaned, aligned, and merged on the `Year` column.

---

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Process Flow)

1. **Load raw CSVs** exported from RBI DBIE.
2. **Trim header noise** and remove extra descriptive rows present in RBI exports.
3. **Standardize `Year`** column as integer (1950‚Äì2024).
4. **Handle missing values**:

   * Replace `-` or `...` with `NaN`.
   * If small gaps exist, fill with interpolation or domain-considered imputation.
5. **Convert numeric strings** (with commas, parentheses) to numeric dtype.
6. **Rename columns** for consistency (e.g., `CPI_AllIndia`, `Inflation_Rate`).
7. **Merge** CPI and economic datasets on `Year`.
8. **Create derived features**: year-on-year inflation, GDP growth rates, lags of core variables, rolling means where necessary.
9. **Train/test split**: time-based split (train: 1974‚Äì2010, test: 2011‚Äì2023) used for forecasting and evaluation.

---

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ‚Äî (Process Flow)

* Time-series plots of `GDP`, `GNI`, `PerCapita_GDP`, and `Inflation_Rate`.
* Correlation heatmaps between growth and inflation metrics.
* Distribution checks, skewness, and variance analysis for each series.
* Stationarity checks (ADF and KPSS tests) to detect non-stationary behavior.
* Visual inspection for structural breaks or policy-era changes (pre/post liberalization).
* Outlier detection and year-by-year comparison for major economic events (e.g., 1991 reforms, global crises).

**50-word summary after EDA (example placed in notebook):**
After EDA we cleaned and merged CPI and macro datasets, converted variables to numeric, tested stationarity, visualized trends and correlations, engineered lag features, and split data for modeling ‚Äî setting the dataset for VAR econometric analysis and machine-learning forecasting (Random Forest, XGBoost).

---

## üî¨ Time Series Stationarity & VAR Preparation (Process Flow)

* Conducted **ADF** and **KPSS** tests for all series.
* Differenced non-stationary series to achieve stationarity where required.
* Tested for cointegration where appropriate; if cointegrated, considered Vector Error Correction (VEC) concepts.
* Determined optimal VAR lag order using **AIC/BIC/HQIC**.
* Scaled and aligned series for VAR input.

---

## üìà VAR Model & Granger Causality (Process Flow)

* Fit **VAR** on stationary/differenced variables.
* Run **Granger causality** tests to identify predictive directionality (e.g., whether inflation Granger-causes GDP growth or vice versa).
* Store IRFs and variance decompositions for interpretation.

---

## üìâ Impulse Response Analysis (IRA) 

Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) trace the effect of a one-time shock to one variable (e.g., a sudden 1% rise in inflation) on the future values of other variables (GDP, GNI) in the VAR system. IRA provides a temporal, causal-style view ‚Äî useful to interpret economic dynamics (short- vs long-run effects).
**Note:** IRA is included as an econometric validation step to illustrate dynamic responses, but it is complementary ‚Äî not required ‚Äî for ML forecasting.

---

## üîé Era-Based Comparative Analysis 
* Split the dataset into **pre-1991** (pre-liberalization) and **post-1991** eras.
* Compare volatility, inflation‚Äìgrowth correlation, and impulse responses across eras.
* Note regime-specific changes in structural relationships.

---

## üî¨ Business Cycle Analysis (Decomposition + Spectral)

* Decomposed series into **trend**, **seasonal** (if any at annual frequency minimal), and **residual** using STL/HP filter.
* Conducted **spectral analysis** to detect cyclical frequencies and business cycle periodicities.
* Linked cycle phases with macroeconomic events.

---

## üß© Forecasting Framework & Feature Engineering (Process Flow)

* Created lag features (t‚àí1, t‚àí2,...), rolling means, and percent changes.
* Included macro indicators and lagged CPI as predictors.
* Applied standard scaling where needed for ML algorithms.
* Time-series aware train-test split to prevent leakage.

---

## üß† XGBoost Model Development & Tuning


* Handles non-linear relationships between inflation and growth metrics.
* Robust regularization (L1/L2) helps mitigate overfitting.
* Efficient on small to medium time-series datasets when engineered features are good.
* Can ingest many lagged and derived features easily.

**Implementation details (what we did):

* Model: `XGBRegressor(n_estimators=150, max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.05, random_state=42)`.
* Input features: lagged inflation, lagged GDP growth, per-capita indicators, rolling stats, calendar-year features.
* Training period: 1974‚Äì2010; testing: 2011‚Äì2023.
* Evaluation metrics: **RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R¬≤**.
* Hyperparameter tuning: grid search for `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `learning_rate` (where computationally feasible).
* Final reported performance: (from notebook) **Train RMSE ‚âà 0.0529, Train MAPE ‚âà 0.78%, Train R¬≤ ‚âà 0.9996; Test RMSE ‚âà 4.1268, Test MAPE ‚âà 48.09%, Test R¬≤ ‚âà -0.2167.**

**Interpretation & notes:**

* XGBoost shows near-perfect fit on training data and moderate performance on test data ‚Üí indicates **some overfitting**, likely due to limited annual observations and strong in-sample patterns.
* Still, XGBoost **improves over the naive baseline** (last-value method) by about **25% in RMSE**, showing real predictive gains.

## üÜö Model Performance & Final Comparison (VAR vs XGBoost)

| Criteria                |                          VAR (Econometric) |                                                 XGBoost (ML) |
| ----------------------- | -----------------------------------------: | -----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Purpose                 |                Explain dynamics, causality |                                       Predictive performance |
| Captures nonlinearity   |                 (linear unless extended)   |                                           (trees + boosting) |
| Requires stationarity   |                                     (yes)  |       No strict requirement (but features may be stationary) |
| Interpretability        |                        High (coeffs, IRFs) |                         Moderate (feature importances, SHAP) |
| Performance on test set |   Good for short-term structural forecasts |       Typically better when complex nonlinear patterns exist |
| Useful for this project | Provides economic intuition (Granger, IRF) | Best for accurate forecasting and capturing complex patterns |

**Recommendation:** Use both. VAR + IRF for **econometric interpretation and causal insight**; XGBoost for **practical forecasting** and scenario predictions. In the README and report, highlight both outputs and reconcile differences.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* **Non-stationarity:** Several key time series were non-stationary and required differencing ‚Äî this complicates both VAR interpretation and ML feature design.
* **Annual frequency & small sample size:** Only annual observations (1950‚Äì2024) limit the amount of training data and model generalizability.
* **Structural breaks & external shocks:** Major events (1991 reforms, global financial crisis, pandemic) create regime shifts that are hard to model with stationary assumptions.
* **Model overfitting risk:** XGBoost fits training data extremely well; careful cross-validation and regularization are needed.
* **Measurement / metadata issues:** RBI exports often include header rows or formatting quirks; careful cleaning is required.
* **Unobserved confounders:** Variables such as fiscal policy, monetary stance, exchange rates, global demand are not fully captured here.

---

## üîÆ Future Improvements (Goals & Enhancements)

* **Add additional predictors:** Include interest rates, exchange rate, unemployment, fiscal deficit, trade balance, and world GDP growth.
* **Higher-frequency data:** Use quarterly series if RBI or other official sources allow, to increase training samples.
* **Ensemble models:** Blend VAR forecasts with XGBoost/Random Forest for hybrid predictions.
* **Advanced stationarity handling:** Test cointegration and implement VECM when needed; use transformations that preserve economic interpretability.
* **Model explainability:** Use SHAP values to explain XGBoost predictions per-year and identify influential features.
* **Real-time pipeline:** Build a web app to update forecasts as new RBI releases arrive.
* **Scenario forecasting:** Provide policy scenario runs (e.g., inflation shock scenarios, fiscal tightening scenarios).
* **Deploy forecasting dashboard** for interactive visualization and decision-support.

**Primary future forecasting goal:** Build an operational inflation forecasting module to predict annual CPI and evaluate expected GDP growth responses ‚Äî useful for policy simulation and business planning.
