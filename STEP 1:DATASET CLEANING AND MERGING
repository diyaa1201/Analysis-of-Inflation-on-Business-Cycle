Data Cleaning & Merging Summary

We cleaned and merged two datasets — India’s macroeconomic indicators and CPI inflation data (1970–2024) — to create a unified, analysis-ready dataset.
Key steps included:

Removed redundant headers, formatted numeric columns, and replaced missing markers with NaN.

Standardized year formats (e.g., 2024-25 → 2024_25) for alignment.

Performed an inner join on the Year column, yielding 55 complete years (1970–2024).

Handled missing values by retaining complete inflation indices (CPI_AL, CPI_IW, CPI_IW_Food) and interpolating minor gaps.

Final dataset: 55 rows × 9 columns, fully cleaned, type-consistent, and chronologically ordered — forming a robust base for inflation-growth analysis.
